I built this little cli app because I wanted random desktop backgrounds that matched my desktop resolution without having to go through the monotonous task of looking through subreddits for the right resolution.

Plus I am new to go so it was a fun little project to help me learn. Hope you like it and it saves you some time. cheers.
